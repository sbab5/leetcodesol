Data type refers to the type of value a variable has and the way the computer interprets it.
Each data type has a different size. Youâ€™ve studied 5 different data types and the sizes of the data types:
Integer: 4 bytes
Long: 8 bytes
Float: 4 bytes
Double: 8 bytes
Character: 1 bytes

public class Solution {
    public static int dataTypes(String type) {
        // Write your code here
        switch(type){
            case  "Integer": 
            return 4;
            case "Long":
            return 8;
            case "Float":
            return 4;
            case "Double":
            return 8;
            case "Chararcter":
            return 1;
        }
        return 0;
